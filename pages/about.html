        hi! i'm usersniper.<br>
        <br>
        i'm a twice-certified IT guy who likes doing
        some of the most random bullshit you've ever
        heard of on the internet.<br>
        <br>
        for instance, i made geometry dash run on a
        video game console made in the early '80s.
        yeah. talk about batshit insane.<br>
        <br>
        i've always loved computers; from the first
        time i used one in 2013 up until now, i've
        wanted to push them to their absolute limit,
        whether it be new or old. most of my time is
        spent making games and music for the Nintendo
        Entertainment System, though on occasion i'll
        branch out to other 8-bit machines like the
        Commander X16.<br>
        <br>
        anyway, a bit more about me: i'm 18, christian
        (not the toxic type!!!), and currently going 
        to college for software engineering.<br>
        as for games, Team Fortress 2, Minecraft:
        Java Edition, and Geometry Dash are my go-to
        titles. I've played all three since late 2013
        and haven't stopped!<br>
